# ovaries, but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries. In
# other words, what we call "the fruit" (because duh!, it looks

# urban areas. The leaves are leathery and ovate, with toothed
# margins. The tree is evergreen and can be a large bush or a
# small tree. Each flower, which forms in the summer, is white
# and five-petaled, about Â¼ inch wide. The clusters of orange-
# red fruit ripen from about November into January.""")
