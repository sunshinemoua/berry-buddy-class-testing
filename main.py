    bushes with somewhat vining stalks that arise from the roots. When cut back or
    burned back, the plant will send up many very straight stalks.
    The stalks of the gooseberries are covered in spines. The fruits of goose-berry are
    also covered in little spines. Currants, on the other hand, have no spines on the stalk
    or fruit. But both plants have the very same growth patterns, and leaves that look
    like a three-lobed mitten.
    I prefer the currants because they are easier to collect and have no spines. But
    both are useful, and both have their adherents.
    The fruits are small, but you can get a fair amount if you find a good patch and
    carefully pick away. You never seem to be able to gather as much as you want. For

    common in Southern California; F. purshiana and its three

    California. These are small shrubs to large trees, depending on
    location and species. F. californica is typically no more than

meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's
ovaries, but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries. In
other words, what we call "the fruit" (because duh!, it looks
like a fruit) is the receptacle, and all the little seeds on the

margins. The tree is evergreen and can be a large bush or a
